TODO:
[catan.js]
* Remove hard-coded initial board state
* Add interface and functions to handle setting up initial board state (validity functions are g2g)
* Handle rolling 7s: Fill in stubs for discard and move_thief (+ steal function?)
* Handle playing development cards (can reuse move_thief for soldier)

[client/app.js]
* Delete temporary functions used for the horrible placeholder interface

[UI]
* Replace placeholder UI with ability to click vertices/edges on the board
* Consider improving or adding the following assets:
	Thief
	Settlement
	City
	Chit (Replace text with sprite)
	Mini icons for each resource (for brief animation when harvested and menus)
	Card for each resource
	Card for each development card
	Custom art for each tile instead of tinting generic hexagons
	Dice

* Trading menu(s)
* Offset text for chits appropriately (unless using sprite?)

[...]
* Functions to handle trading
* Chat
* Ports
* Add sound effects
* Compute longest road
* Add function checking for win condition and add win/reset screen
